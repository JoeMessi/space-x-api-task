# Giuseppe's Space X API task

Hi and thanks for taking the time to review this

I thought I would say a bit what I did here

For this project I used React along with Typescript and Styled Components, Zustand as a state manager, Axios to make HTTP calls to the API and Jest along with the React Testing Library for testing

It’s a small app, I make 2 api calls, one to fetch a list of spaceX rockets and the other one to fetch a list of chronological historical facts about this company

I used react router for routing, each of the side navigation links takes you to a different route, then once in that specific route there’s the relevant api calls that fetches the corresponding data, which is then consumed and displayed on the page

I added testing to those components that have logical conditions

I used a state manager, Zustand, in order to have the state consumed in multiple location of the app

The app is also fully responsive adapting to smaller screens view

Thanks :)
